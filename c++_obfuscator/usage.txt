Coding guidelines to make the obfuscator more effective:

* Dont use variable names that include type names ie. int int_one = 5; 
	Obfuscator will pick up both ints and change them messing up your program

* Dont use single character variables two characters is usually fine. ie int i = 0; should be int count = 0;

* Put defines after using declaration and add names to the config file ie.

using namespace std;
#define hello 100
#define hoopla(x) x*5
